      '''Gestational diabetes is diabetes diagnosed for the first time during pregnancy (gestation). Like other types of diabetes, gestational diabetes affects how your cells use sugar (glucose). Gestational diabetes causes high blood sugar that can affect your pregnancy and your baby's health.
While any pregnancy complication is concerning, there's good news. During pregnancy you can help control gestational diabetes by eating healthy foods, exercising and, if necessary, taking medication. Controlling blood sugar can keep you and your baby healthy and prevent a difficult delivery.
If you have gestational diabetes during pregnancy, generally your blood sugar returns to its usual level soon after delivery. But if you've had gestational diabetes, you have a higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes. You'll need to be tested for changes in blood sugar more ofte

Due to the changes in pregnant women's metabolism, this sugar is absorbed more slowly by their cells, so their blood sugar levels rise. If certain levels are regularly exceeded, the woman is considered to have gestational diabetes.

  static String gestationalDiabetesEffects = '''
Gestational diabetes usually doesn’t have any consequences for the mother and child. Babies born to women who have gestational diabetes have a slightly heavier birth weight on average. But this is not a reason for concern.

During the birth of larger babies, the phase after the head has come out often takes longer. If one of the child's shoulders gets stuck in the mother's pelvis (a situation known as “shoulder dystocia”), the child may not get enough oxygen. Midwives and doctors then react quickly, to be on the safe side. This can lead to minor injuries in the child and sometimes in the mother. Although these injuries usually heal well, being in that situation can be distressing for the mother. But emergency situations and more severe injuries are rare.

Higher blood sugar levels also increase the risk of a rare problem during pregnancy known as pre-eclampsia. In pre-eclampsia, more protein than normal is flushed out of the body in the urine, blood pressure increases, and fluid builds up in the body. If left untreated, pre-eclampsia can harm both the mother and the child.

Women who have gestational diabetes are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes later in life.

  static String gestationalDiabetesDiagnosis = '''
The best way of diagnosing gestational diabetes is by doing a glucose tolerance test. This test measures how the body reacts to a large amount of glucose (sugar). It is offered between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy (during the second trimester).

To find out whether it makes sense to do a glucose tolerance test, you will do what is known as a glucose challenge test first. This involves drinking a glass of water with sugar dissolved in it. One hour later, a sample of blood is taken from a vein in your arm to determine your blood sugar level. If the blood sugar level is found to be high, you will be asked to return to do a glucose tolerance test. This test is similar to the challenge test, but it involves more preparation and takes longer. For instance, it has to be done on an empty stomach.

The test results are documented in your maternity records. In Germany, the costs of the glucose tolerance test are covered by statutory health insurers.The results are documented in your maternity records. In Germany, the costs of glucose tolerance tests are covered by statutory health insurers.

  static String gestationalDiabetesTreatment = '''
A change in diet is usually enough to make the blood sugar levels return to normal. Women who have gestational diabetes can also seek advice from their doctor. Special dietary counseling can be helpful too. Another way to lower your blood sugar levels is by getting more exercise.

But some pregnant women have such high blood sugar levels for so long that they have to inject insulin or, in rare cases, take medicine for diabetes.

The doctor will offer to measure the woman’s blood sugar levels again after the baby is born. If her blood sugar levels have returned to normal, no more treatment is needed. All women who develop gestational diabetes are advised to talk with their doctor after the birth to decide whether more tests or lifestyle changes would be a good idea.
